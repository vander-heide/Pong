# Pong
I decided to create Pong in Java a while ago as a project for an intro into game dev and decided to finally upload it somewhere. This project was by no means intended to by fully finished, polished, or bug free. 

In terms of the current state if it, this is a basic Pong game playable by one person in a race to 10 points against a basic CPU which just follows the ball.

If you do happen to look into the code, yes there are functions not currently used (bacause they were previous implementations that I decided to no longer use), yes there may also be extraneous comments, print lines, or random snipits of code elsewhere. Full disclosure I did follow a video tutorial series for a dodge the enemy game (just for reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gir2R7G9ws) but changed it in order to make Pong instead.

Thanks 
:)
